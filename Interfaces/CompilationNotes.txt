Windows compilation notes, using mingw gcc:

Following headers are not included by default:
- <limits> numeric limits not found. (PointBaseType.h)
- <bitset>
- <memory>
- <algorithm>

Struct in a struct : 
sub-structure needs to redeclare types of super-structure.

Lambdas : 
Lambdas do not like capture by reference &, in particular for const integers.

Time : 
Use <time.h> and not <sys/time.h>

Exceptions : 
(May be needed to enable exceptions.)

In mathematica:
Careful with "\n" and "\r" ends of lines.
Executable should not be preceded with "./"
